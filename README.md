# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± I'm passionate about building web applications and exploring new technologies.

ðŸ’¼ Currently, I'm working on projects that explore the possibilities of Node.js and Anguler, creating scalable and efficient backend solutions.

ðŸš€ I enjoy collaborating on open-source projects and contributing to the developer community.

- Here in my GitHub, you'll find a variety of repositories containing personal projects, university work, and studies that I'm excited to share.
